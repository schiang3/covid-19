The goal is to label the articles in order to help people extract key information from massive information content and
to retrieve key words related articles to get target results. Natural language processing (NLP) was included to achieve machine translation.
The articles were grouped by using two clustering methods and labeled by Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA). BM25, a search engine ranking algorithm, was utilized to materialize
information retrieval. The results demonstrated that k-means clustering was the best clustering
method. Building on k-means clustering, LDA extracted the top word such as health,
occurring frequently in most clusters. BM25 finds the related research paper with the search
query for the further answer search.
